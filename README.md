# Volopay-Backend-Assignment
Created APIs to fetch data from the given Dataset.

The framework that I have used here to Develop APIs was ASP.NET.
Here I have imported the data directly from dataset.
The API that I have created in this Assignment was Get All data, Get By Id, Gettting total number of items (seats) sold in the Marketing by department during the third quarter (Q3) of the year,  Get by percentage of sold items (seats) by department wise, Getting Monthly Sales.

You can run this assignment at your end by downloading the project and open it using Microsoft Visual studio and then build the project. It'll automatically open Localhost swagger page with all the APIs that I have created you can check there or In Postman as well by entering the Create a new request: Click on the "New" button in the top left corner and select "Request" from the dropdown menu. Set the request details: Enter the request URL by appending the endpoint path to your base URL. For example, if your base URL is http://localhost:7150, the complete URL for the /api/nth_most_total_item endpoint would be http://localhost:5000/api/nth_most_total_item.

 I have Implemented some validations to check whether User is entering proper data or not and handled exception as well.
 I have chekced my data using swagger. But Same can be check in Postman as well.
 
 Below are some of the images of Swagger Output results:

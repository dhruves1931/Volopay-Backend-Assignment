# Volopay-Backend-Assignment
Created APIs to fetch data from the given Dataset.

The framework that I have used here to Develop APIs was ASP.NET.
Here I have imported the data directly from dataset.
The API that I have created in this Assignment was Get All data, Get By Id, Gettting total number of items (seats) sold in the Marketing by department during the third quarter (Q3) of the year,  Get by percentage of sold items (seats) by department wise, Getting Monthly Sales.

 I have Implemented some validations to check whether User is entering proper data or not and handled exception as well.
 I have chekced my data using swagger. But Same can be check in Postman as well.
 
 Below are some of the images of Swagger Output results:
